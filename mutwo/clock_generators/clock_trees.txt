clock generators
================

Basic clock generator is `treelib.Tree`.

Each leaf represents one rhythmical layer.

Each rhythmical layer leaks events.

Each layer can only once leak an event, than it has
to wait until all higher leaves leaked their event.

Tree:

    A -> B -> C
           -> D


Resulting event drop pattern:

    A            A                        A
    
     B    B         B          B
    
       C    D          C   C       D


Each Leaf has a minima and maxima event leak count.

Only after all events have been leaked, the lower leaf
can leak an event again.

Furthermore - because it is an tree - one leaf can have
more than one child leaves. Then it will cycle between
both children.

To receive a new clock from a tree the structure is:


    1 tree = ...

        We first need to define the event by declaring different
        layers/leaves and stacking them on each other.

    2. TreeToClockEvent.convert(tree, root_cycle_count)

        Then we apply the procedure which has been described above.

    3. event.post_process()

        Finally we post-process the generated event by adding
        additional data (e.g. more rests -> fermata, etc.)

What's nice is that a leaf generated event can literally be anything...

    ...from a long SequentialEvent (which may have been generated from an earlier tree->clockevent call)

    ...to a single SimpleEvent

    ...to even no events at all (e.g. an empty SequentialEvent)


This gives the technique the possibility to describe the very abstract
to the very concrete.

Background:
==========

time is divided into

    years

        months

            weeks

                days

                    hours
                        
                        minutes

                            seconds


This is very similar to colotomic structures.
